Address Bar Shortcuts
=====================
Redirect to subreddits, reddit users, and *chan boards using the address bar

# Legacy / old redirect command
This uses "r/\<subreddit>", "u/\<user>", "b/\<board>", and "b8/\<board>" as commands in the url bar. I don't plan on depreciating this.

# Omnibox
This uses the omnibox for redirecting. Instead of having a forward-slash in the command, you use a space.

# Omnibox commands
* "[r] r \<board>" - Directs to a reddit subreddit. (*omni-all.xpi*, *omni-reddit-sub.xpi*)
* "[r] u \<user>" - Directs to a reddit user. (*omni-all.xpi*, *omni-reddit-user.xpi*)
* "[r] b \<board>" - Directs to a 4chan board. (*omni-all.xpi*, *omni-4chan.xpi*)
* "[r] b8 \<board>" - Directs to a 8chan board. (*omni-all.xpi*, *omni-8chan.xpi*)

(Note: the [r] in each command is only required if using "omni-all.xpi").
